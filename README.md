# ha-wled
Fork of the HA WLED component, with a few improvements for people using segments and presets intensively.

## Main improvements:
* Segments keep their name relative to the device name after removing and re-adding
* Support for the temperature sensor provided by the "Temperature" usermod
** Very useful if you're using one of the QuinLED controllers!
